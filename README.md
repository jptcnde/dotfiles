# Dotfiles

Obviously this setup works for me, a JavaScript developer, but this particular setup may not work for you. If this particular setup doesn't work for you, please steal ideas from this and if you like, contribute back tips, tricks, PRs, and other tidbits if you like!

## Initial Setup and Installation

### Backup

First, you may want to backup any existing files that exist so this doesn't overwrite your work.

Run `install/backup.sh` to backup all symlinked files to a `~/dotfiles-backup` directory.

This will not delete any of these files, and the install scripts will not overwrite any existing. After the backup is complete, you can delete the files from your home directory to continue installation.

### Installation

Then, clone the dotfiles repository to your computer. This can be placed anywhere, and symbolic links will be created to reference it from your home directory.

```bash
➜ git clone https://github.com/nicknisi/dotfiles.git ~/.dotfiles
➜ cd ~/.dotfiles
➜ ./install.sh
```

`install.sh` will start by initializing the submodules used by this repository (if any). **Read through this file and comment out anything you don't want installed.** Then, it will install all symbolic links into your home directory. Every file with a `.symlink` extension will be symlinked to the home directory with a `.` in front of it. As an example, `vimrc.symlink` will be symlinked in the home directory as `~/.vimrc`. Then, this script will create a `~/.vim-tmp` directory in your home directory, as this is where vim is configured to place its temporary files. Additionally, all files in the `$DOTFILES/config` directory will be symlinked to the `~/.config/` directory for applications that follow the [XDG base directory specification](http://standards.freedesktop.org/basedir-spec/basedir-spec-latest.html), such as neovim.

## ZSH Setup

ZSH is configured in the `zshrc.symlink` file, which will be symlinked to the home directory. The following occurs in this file:

* set the `EDITOR` to nvim
* Load any `~/.terminfo` setup
* Set the `CODE_DIR` variable, pointing to the location where the code projects exist for exclusive autocompletion with the `c` command
* Recursively search the `$DOTFILES/zsh` directory for files ending in .zsh and source them
* Setup zplug plugin manager for zsh plugins and installed them.
* source a `~/.localrc` if it exists so that additional configurations can be made that won't be kept track of in this dotfiles repo. This is good for things like API keys, etc.
* Add the `~/bin` and `$DOTFILES/bin` directories to the path
* And more...

### Prompt

The prompt is meant to be simple while still providing a lot of information to the user, particularly about the status of the git project, if the PWD is a git project. This prompt sets `precmd`, `PROMPT` and `RPROMPT`.

The `precmd` shows the current working directory in it and the `RPROMPT` shows the git and suspended jobs info.

#### Prompt Git Info

The git info shown on the `RPROMPT` displays the current branch name, and whether it is clean or dirty.

Additionally, there are ⇣ and ⇡ arrows that indicate whether a commit has happened and needs to be pushed (⇡), and whether commits have happened on the remote branch that need to be pulled (⇣).
